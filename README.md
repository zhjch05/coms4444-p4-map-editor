# Map Editor for PPS 2018 Project 4 (COMS4444 Columbia Fall 2018)

The site is deployed at https://pps4map.jczhang.com

You can also clone this repo and run `yarn install`/`yarn start` to use it locally.

`Refresh` button is to ensure the GUI is completely synced with React state. But this won't happen usually and from my test there is no syncronization issue.
